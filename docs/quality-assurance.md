# Quality Assurance Framework

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive quality assurance framework for traffic-control-go, ensuring high-quality delivery through systematic testing, code quality measures, and continuous monitoring.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing
**Objective**: Test individual components in isolation

- **Framework**: Go's built-in testing + testify/assert
- **Coverage Target**: ≥80% line coverage
- **Standards**: Table-driven tests, clear naming, edge case coverage
- **Execution**: Every commit via CI/CD pipeline
- **Location**: `*_test.go` files alongside source code

**Example Structure**:
```go
func TestHTBQdiscCreation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        device   string
        rate     string
        expected error
    }{
        {"valid HTB", "eth0", "100mbps", nil},
        {"invalid device", "", "100mbps", ErrInvalidDevice},
        {"invalid rate", "eth0", "invalid", ErrInvalidRate},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### 2. Integration Testing
**Objective**: Test component interactions and kernel integration

- **Framework**: Go test with veth pair setup
- **Scope**: Netlink communication, kernel TC integration
- **Environment**: Docker containers with network namespaces
- **Execution**: Pre-merge validation in CI
- **Location**: `test/integration/` directory

**Key Integration Tests**:
- Netlink adapter communication
- TC qdisc/class/filter operations
- Event sourcing persistence
- Statistics collection accuracy

### 3. System Testing
**Objective**: End-to-end validation with real traffic control

- **Framework**: Custom test harness with iperf3
- **Scope**: Complete workflow validation
- **Environment**: Privileged CI containers with real interfaces
- **Validation**: Bandwidth enforcement, traffic shaping verification
- **Location**: `test/system/` directory

### 4. Performance Testing
**Objective**: Validate performance targets and detect regressions

- **Framework**: Go benchmarks + custom performance tests
- **Metrics**: 
  - API latency: <10ms for configuration operations
  - Throughput: 1000+ operations per second
  - Memory usage: No leaks in long-running tests
- **Execution**: Every commit + detailed release analysis
- **Tools**: `go test -bench`, `benchstat` for regression detection

### 5. Security Testing
**Objective**: Identify and prevent security vulnerabilities

- **Static Analysis**: `gosec` for vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot alerts
- **Input Validation**: Fuzzing tests for external inputs
- **Privilege Testing**: Minimal root privilege usage validation

## Code Quality Measures

### Automated Quality Checks

Our CI pipeline enforces the following quality gates:

```yaml
Quality Checks:
  - golangci-lint: Code quality and style analysis
  - gosec: Security vulnerability detection
  - go vet: Static analysis for common errors
  - gofmt -s: Code formatting consistency
  - go mod verify: Dependency integrity
  - Test coverage: Minimum 80% coverage requirement
```

### Code Review Process

**Requirements**:
- All code changes require peer review
- Domain expert review for kernel/networking code
- Security review for privilege-related changes

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

- [ ] Tests cover the changes adequately
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

### Documentation Standards
