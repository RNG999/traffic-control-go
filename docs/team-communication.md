# Team Communication and Collaboration Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the communication and collaboration framework for the traffic-control-go project, ensuring effective teamwork, knowledge sharing, and maintaining a positive team environment.

## Communication Channels

### 1. GitHub Issues
**Purpose**: Primary channel for task tracking and formal decisions  
**Use Cases**:
- Feature requests and bug reports
- Technical discussions requiring documentation
- Task assignment and progress tracking
- Decision records and rationale

**Best Practices**:
- Use descriptive titles and clear descriptions
- Link related issues and PRs
- Update status regularly
- Close issues promptly when resolved

### 2. Pull Request Reviews
**Purpose**: Code quality assurance and knowledge sharing  
**Use Cases**:
- Code review and feedback
- Technical discussions about implementation
- Knowledge transfer between team members
- Quality gate enforcement

**Review Guidelines**:
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours for initial review
- **Thoroughness**: Check logic, style, tests, and documentation
- **Tone**: Constructive, specific, and educational
- **Approval**: At least one approval required before merge

### 3. GitHub Discussions
**Purpose**: Open-ended design discussions and questions  
**Use Cases**:
- Architecture and design proposals
- Technical RFC discussions
- Community questions and support
- Feature brainstorming

**Categories**:
- üí° Ideas: Feature proposals and enhancements
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Design and technical discussions
- ‚ùì Q&A: Questions and support requests
- üì¢ Announcements: Project updates and news

### 4. Issue Comments
**Purpose**: Ongoing communication within specific contexts  
**Use Cases**:
- Status updates on tasks
- Clarification requests
- Progress reporting
- Blocker notifications

**Comment Etiquette**:
- Be concise and relevant
- Use @mentions for specific attention
- Update rather than duplicate information
- Link to related resources

## Collaboration Practices

### Regular Meetings

#### Weekly Team Sync
**When**: Every Monday, 10:00 AM  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Agenda**:
1. Previous week accomplishments
2. Current week priorities
3. Blockers and dependencies
4. Project board review

**Format**: Asynchronous update followed by optional sync discussion

#### Bi-weekly Technical Discussion
**When**: Every other Thursday, 2:00 PM  
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Purpose**: Deep technical discussions, architecture decisions, knowledge sharing

### Asynchronous Communication

#### Daily Updates
- **What**: Brief progress updates on active tasks
- **Where**: Issue comments or PR descriptions
- **When**: End of working day
- **Format**: What I did, what's next, any blockers

#### Status Reporting
- **Weekly Summary**: Posted in team discussion thread
- **Milestone Updates**: Progress against milestone goals
- **Metrics Reporting**: Key performance indicators

### Response Time Expectations

| Communication Type | Expected Response Time |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Critical Issues (P0) | Within 2 hours |
| High Priority (P1) | Within 24 hours |
| Normal Priority | Within 48 hours |
| Code Reviews | Within 24 hours |
| General Questions | Within 72 hours |

## Team Environment Optimization

### Focus Time Protection
- **Deep Work Blocks**: 2-4 hour uninterrupted periods
- **No Meeting Times**: Wednesday afternoons reserved for deep work
- **Notification Management**: Batch non-urgent communications
- **Context Switching**: Minimize by grouping similar tasks

### Documentation Practices
- **Decision Records**: Document all significant decisions in issues
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADR (Architecture Decision Records) in docs/
- **Meeting Notes**: Key outcomes documented in relevant issues
- **Knowledge Base**: Maintain wiki for common patterns and solutions

### Work-Life Balance
- **Core Hours**: Overlap hours for collaboration (10 AM - 3 PM)
- **Flexible Schedule**: Accommodate different time zones and preferences
- **Vacation Coverage**: Clear handoff procedures
- **Emergency Only**: Define what constitutes an emergency

## Psychological Safety Framework

### Core Principles

#### 1. Learning Culture
- **Questions Encouraged**: No question is too basic
- **Experimentation**: Safe to try new approaches
- **Failure Learning**: Mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular tech talks and demos

#### 2. Constructive Feedback
- **Specific**: Focus on specific behaviors or code
- **Actionable**: Provide clear improvement suggestions
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge good work alongside improvements
- **Timely**: Give feedback close to the event

#### 3. Inclusive Environment
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Actively seek different viewpoints
- **Equal Voice**: Everyone's input is valued
- **Respectful Disagreement**: Focus on ideas, not persons
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect different backgrounds

#### 4. Team Recognition
- **Individual Achievements**: Acknowledge personal contributions
- **Team Successes**: Celebrate collective accomplishments
- **Learning Moments**: Share lessons from challenges
- **Peer Recognition**: Encourage team members to recognize each other

## Communication Templates

### Status Update Template
```markdown
**Date**: [Date]
**Status**: üü¢ On Track / üü° At Risk / üî¥ Blocked

**Completed**:
- [Task 1 with PR/Issue link]
- [Task 2 with PR/Issue link]

**In Progress**:
- [Current task and expected completion]

**Next**:
- [Planned work for tomorrow/next period]

**Blockers**:
- [Any impediments needing help]
```

### Technical Decision Template
```markdown
**Decision**: [Brief decision statement]
**Date**: [Date]
**Participants**: [@user1, @user2]

**Context**: [Why this decision was needed]

**Options Considered**:
