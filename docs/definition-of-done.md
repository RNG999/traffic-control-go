# Definition of Done

This document defines the quality standards and acceptance criteria for all work completed in the traffic-control-go project.

## General Definition of Done

Every task, feature, and deliverable must meet these criteria before being considered complete:

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code implemented according to specifications
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- [ ] No critical or high-priority bugs introduced

### Testing Requirements  
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (minimum 80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing where applicable
- [ ] Performance regression tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed for critical user paths

### Documentation
- [ ] Code documentation updated (godoc comments)
- [ ] API documentation updated if applicable
- [ ] README updated if new features affect usage
- [ ] Examples/demos working and current

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All automated tests pass in CI pipeline
- [ ] Code coverage >= 80% maintained
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected by static analysis
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- [ ] golangci-lint passes without warnings

### Deployment
- [ ] Changes merged to main branch
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completes successfully
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained (or breaking changes documented)

## Feature-Specific Acceptance Criteria Template

For each feature or user story, define specific acceptance criteria:

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All functional requirements met as specified
- [ ] Feature works as expected in happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions handled appropriately

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements met (latency, throughput)
- [ ] Reliability requirements met (error handling, recovery)
- [ ] Usability requirements met (API design, developer experience)

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Feature integrates properly with existing codebase
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Logging and monitoring capabilities added where appropriate

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Usage examples provided and tested
- [ ] API changes documented
- [ ] Migration guide provided for breaking changes (if any)

## Quality Metrics

### Code Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: >= 80% line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Critical paths covered
- **End-to-End Tests**: Happy path scenarios covered

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: < 10ms for configuration operations
- **Throughput**: Support 1000+ operations per second
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks in long-running processes

### Security Standards
- **Static Analysis**: Pass gosec security scanner
- **Dependency Scanning**: No high/critical vulnerability dependencies
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs properly validated

## Review Process

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and standards
- [ ] Logic is clear and maintainable
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests cover the changes adequately
- [ ] Documentation is updated as needed

### Acceptance Review
- [ ] Feature meets all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Definition of Done checklist completed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained (if required)
- [ ] Ready for deployment

## Continuous Improvement

This Definition of Done should be:
- Reviewed and updated regularly based on lessons learned
- Applied consistently across all work items
- Used as a quality gate for all deployments
- Referenced in retrospectives for process improvement

Any proposed changes to this document should be discussed with the team and approved through the standard change management process.
