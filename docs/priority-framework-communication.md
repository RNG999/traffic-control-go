**Priority Assignment**: [Level]
**Rationale**: [Why this priority was chosen]
**Expected Timeline**: [When work will begin/complete]
**Dependencies**: [Any blocking or dependent issues]
**Stakeholder Impact**: [Who is affected and how]
```

### 2. Priority Changes

**Triggers for Priority Changes**:
- New information affecting scope or urgency
- Resource availability changes
- External dependency updates
- Stakeholder requirement changes

**Change Process**:
1. Priority change proposal with justification
2. Stakeholder notification and feedback period
3. Final decision by project maintainer
4. Updated priority label and documentation
5. Timeline and resource reallocation as needed

**Change Notification Template**:
```markdown
**Priority Change Notification**
**Issue**: #[number] - [title]
**Previous Priority**: [old level]
**New Priority**: [new level]
**Change Reason**: [detailed justification]
**Timeline Impact**: [how this affects schedules]
**Action Required**: [what stakeholders need to do]
```

### 3. Weekly Priority Status
