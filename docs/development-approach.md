# Development Approach and Life Cycle

## Selected Approach: Adaptive Development with Continuous Integration

### Rationale

The traffic-control-go project uses an adaptive development approach based on the following characteristics:

- **High Technical Complexity**: Kernel API integration requires iterative learning and refinement
- **Evolving Requirements**: API design benefits from stakeholder feedback and real-world validation
- **Integration Risk**: Frequent testing with actual kernel interfaces is essential
- **Innovation Factor**: New approaches to TC management require experimentation and validation

## Development Practices

### Continuous Integration
- **Build Frequency**: Every commit
- **Test Execution**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage, linting, security, performance
- **Deployment**: Automated testing in realistic environments

### Iterative Development
- **Iteration Length**: 1-2 weeks
- **Review Cadence**: End of each iteration
- **Adaptation**: Requirements and design refinement based on learning
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular input and validation

### Quality Assurance
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before implementation
- **Code Review**: All code reviewed before merge
- **Performance Testing**: Continuous performance validation
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Risk Management
- **Early Integration**: Test with real kernel APIs from day one
- **Incremental Delivery**: Working software each iteration
- **Continuous Validation**: Regular stakeholder and technical validation
- **Rapid Feedback**: Fast feedback loops for course correction
