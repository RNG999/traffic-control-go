## Approval Authority

### Change Categories and Approval Levels

| Change Type | Examples | Approval Required |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Minor Changes** | Documentation updates, small bug fixes | Developer Self-Approval |
| **Moderate Changes** | Feature enhancements, API additions | Project Maintainer |
| **Major Changes** | Architecture changes, breaking changes | Project Maintainer + Community Review |
| **Critical Changes** | Core design changes, major refactoring | Project Maintainer + Technical Review Board |

### Approval Process
1. **Documentation**: All approvals must be documented in the change request issue
2. **Rationale**: Decision rationale must be provided for all rejections
3. **Conditions**: Conditional approvals must specify conditions clearly
4. **Timeline**: Approval decisions communicated within defined timeframes

---

## Implementation Process

### Upon Approval
