## Detailed Risk Descriptions

### R-001: Kernel API Changes Breaking Netlink Compatibility
**Type**: Threat  
**Impact**: High (could break core functionality)  
**Probability**: Medium (kernel APIs change periodically)  
**Risk Score**: HIGH

**Description**: Linux kernel updates may introduce changes to netlink API or Traffic Control subsystem that could break compatibility with our implementation.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… Monitor kernel development mailing lists
- âœ… Maintain compatibility testing across kernel versions
- âœ… Implement defensive programming practices
- âœ… Create kernel version compatibility matrix

**Status**: ACTIVELY MITIGATED - Comprehensive monitoring and testing procedures in place.

### R-002: Performance Regression in High-Throughput Scenarios
**Type**: Threat  
**Impact**: Medium (affects user experience)  
**Probability**: Medium (common in performance-critical code)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Changes to the codebase may introduce performance regressions that become apparent only under high-throughput network scenarios.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… Implement continuous performance benchmarking
- âœ… Profile code changes for performance impact
- âœ… Set performance regression detection thresholds
- âœ… Maintain performance testing in CI pipeline

**Status**: ACTIVELY MITIGATED - Automated performance monitoring implemented.

---

### R-003: Integration Complexity with Existing TC Configurations
**Type**: Threat  
**Impact**: Medium (user adoption barrier)  
**Probability**: Medium (complex enterprise environments)  
**Risk Score**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Difficulty integrating with existing traffic control setups may limit adoption in complex enterprise environments.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ðŸ”„ Document compatibility with existing TC tools
- ðŸ”„ Provide migration guides and examples
- ðŸ”„ Implement configuration import/export features
- ðŸ”„ Create compatibility testing scenarios

**Status**: MONITORING - Mitigation strategies to be implemented in M3.

---

### R-004: Dependency Security Vulnerabilities
**Type**: Threat  
**Impact**: Medium (security exposure)  
**Probability**: Low (good dependency management)  
**Risk Score**: LOW

**Description**: Security vulnerabilities in project dependencies could expose users to risks.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… Automated dependency scanning (Dependabot)
- âœ… Regular dependency updates
- âœ… Security review process
- âœ… Minimal dependency footprint

**Status**: CONTROLLED - Automated monitoring and update processes active.

---

### R-005: Documentation Gaps Affecting Adoption
**Type**: Threat  
**Impact**: Low (adoption speed)  
**Probability**: Medium (common in technical projects)  
**Risk Score**: LOW

**Description**: Insufficient or unclear documentation may slow user adoption and increase support burden.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive API documentation

## Risk Management Process

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Risk status updates during team meetings
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive risk assessment and new risk identification
- **Quarterly**: Risk management process evaluation and improvement

### Risk Assessment Criteria

#### Impact Levels
- **High**: Could significantly affect project success or user experience
- **Medium**: Noticeable impact but manageable with effort
- **Low**: Minor impact with minimal consequences

#### Probability Levels
- **High**: Very likely to occur (>70% chance)
- **Medium**: May occur (30-70% chance)
- **Low**: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

#### Response Strategies
- **ðŸ”´ Mitigate**: Active measures to reduce impact or probability
- **ðŸŸ¡ Monitor**: Watch for changes, prepare contingency plans
- **ðŸŸ¢ Accept**: Acknowledge risk but take no active measures
- **ðŸ”„ Transfer**: Share or shift risk to external parties

### New Risk Identification
New risks can be identified through:
- Team retrospectives and planning sessions
- Stakeholder feedback
- External environment monitoring
- Technical assessments
- Community input

### Risk Escalation
- **High risks**: Immediate attention and mitigation required
- **Medium risks**: Include in sprint planning and resource allocation
- **Low risks**: Monitor and address as resources permit
